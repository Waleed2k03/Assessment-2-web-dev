        1. Grand Theft Auto 5
    </div>

        I'll be honest I was hesitant to purchase GTA V for a 3rd time (PS3, PS4 & now PS5) but for $9.99 it's truly a worthy next gen upgrade. GTA V on the PlayStation 5 is truly remarkable. The biggest upgrade is the load times across the board, GTA online was so slow on my PS4 pro that I quit playing because the load times killed the vibe for me. I'm happy to report that is no longer an issue, online load times are literally 5x faster than PS4 & story mode is even faster. You can go from PS5 home screen to running around in story mode in about 27 seconds which is incredible when you compare that to the 91 seconds on PS4.

        The next major improvement is the graphics. I wasn't expecting much in this regard but I'm happy to report that I'm pleasantly surprised. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, there are 3 modes available.

        Fidelity- offers the highest quality visuals with Native 4K and Ray Tracing. The only downside to this mode is that it's limited to 30fps.

        Performance mode- allows the game to run in dynamic 4K at 60fps with zero Ray Tracing effects.

        Performance RT- My favorite mode & truly the most stunning of the three modes. Performance RT is like a combination of fidelity and performance modes. It offers a dynamic 4K resolution at 60 fps with ray tracing enabled!

        I've sampled ALL 3 modes (I spent 90 minutes with each to test the difference) and of them all I've found performance RT is absolutely fantastic. I play in a 43inch 4K TV and this game is breathtaking. The updated high resolution textures, the better explosions, increased foliage, massive draw distance, combined with ray tracing and you get a game that looks like a native PS5 game. It's truly amazing a game from 2013 looks as good as it does in 2022. I was shocked when flying around Los Santos and having the entire map within eyesight without waiting for textures to load in with ZERO texture pop.

        In conclusion I have to say the PlayStation 5 version of GTA V is absolutely worth the current $9.99 upgrade (remember it jumps in price after 3 months to $39.99). GTA V still has one of the best written stories in all of gaming, it's got brilliant social commentary, phenomenal emotional sets with heart pounding action. Highly recommend the GTA V Expanded Enhanced version for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox series X|S. Happy gaming<br />

        Masterpiece even in 2021 you cant go wrong with this beauty a vast open-world experience more detailed than some open-worlds from the newer age. it is the best modern interpretation of the world in a video game out there, The online experience is very captivating and I think that's why people disliked the game because of the oppressor MK2, but the truth is the online mode fits to a certain taste, definitely fits to my taste and i have had this game for what? six years now and no matter what game i get let it TLOU pt. 2, Spiderman miles Morales, Spiderman, COD etc i still long to return to GTAV because of that *IT* factor it has cruising down the great ocean highway in an adder listening Mis-Teeq - SCANDALOUS with 5 stars its captivating and there is always something new to be done whether its solving Leonora Johnson's Murder, or helping a freak to discover spaceship parts , joining a cult and trying to infiltrate fort Zancudo to acquire military vehicles its all just fun and if you think you are ever done GTA V just remember there is more beyond the 100 percent, you can hunt, parachute, compete in triathlons. i am not a paid reviewer but all i can say is that GTAV is a game that you can never get over once its in your life its there to stay.

        10/10, *****, 100% whatever you will the game is perfect!<br />

        This is an amazing open world game even 8 years later!
        Its graphics are as great as more modern open world games such as Just Cause 4 and Watchdogs Legion.

        The story is a heartwarming masterpiece and the voice acting paired with the realistic motion capture is stunning.
        If you love cars, boats, planes and helicopters then you'll definitely love the vehicle related features in the game, I was blown away by the vast variety of customisations available for cars! From coloured tire smoke and neon light kits to brilliant accessories and body kits! There's  something for everyone here, I do have to say to keep little children away though. But otherwise it's perfect for older teens and adults alike

        And that's just the story mode! There is a whole world available to play with your friends or with randoms!<br/>

            2. Red Dead Redemption
        </div>
        <p>
            Andrew Newton : <br />
            In simple terms this game is ******* brilliant. The atmosphere in every single moment is perfect. Along with the soundtracks and other background noises like bird song or the whistles of policeman, or the rivers. Rockstar has got this game spot on with this. Nature feels real. The noises of the river and small things like a hoot hoot as an owl flies by, creates such a surreal backdrop.

            Then we get to the actual gameplay of this magnificent experience. This is indeed an experience, not a game. You'll only understand what I mean when you play it. With key moments are displayed perfectly and with the clever use of soundtracks, slow building tension and the further environment. It does indeed make the player on the edge. Then you get to meet the gang. The excellent blend of very in depth character development, them, along with Arthur, you get to see them develop into even more complex characters. So unique.
            Arthur Morgan is a gentleman. Throughout the story you see how this man, with all his witts, sees people for who they actually are. He sees and feels like a real person. A person who stays true to himself. Once he gets TB, he knows that he doesnt have long left, so he goes on a redemption spree. That's the main story anyway. Then with the many endings, which I will not mention, you go onto the epilogue. John Marston, who you will remember from the first red dead redemption. Watch and experience as he re builds his old life and gets revenge. Not as good, as the main story but great nonetheless. The last mission is absolutely worth it.

            Red dead online is good. In the recent months, small things like gang encounters and wolf attacks add the necessary edge to the game and really adds depth to it.The variation in businesses also add a range of different features and activities that players enjoy. Also players on this game seem so much nicer than on Gta, you can actually encounter them without being blown up.  Then there is the different sLet's hope that rockstar continue with these improvements.

            I’ve never been one for reviews but I had to do one for this game.For me this has got to be the greatest video game in history tied with Grand Theft  Auto series(gta 4 especially since that is my favourite gta game) and RDR1. Arthur Morgan is not only the greatest rockstar protagonist but the greatest protagonist in history alongside Niko Bellic and John Marston. Roger Clark as Arthur Morgan is without a doubt one of if not THE greatest performance of all time. Dutch van der Linde and Micah Bell have gotta the best written antagonists ever. Peter Blomquist as Micah Bell is phenomenal as soon as you see Micah you know something’s bad is gonna go down and you absolutely loathe Micah. Peter Blomquist did a fantastic job here. And Benjamin Bryon Davis did a superb job with Dutch van der Linde and Rob Wiethoff(sorry if I spelt that wrong) as John Marston and Alex McKenna as Sadie Adler. Every cast member in my opinion  did a phenomenal  job. Whether you love exploring the world in free roam hunting doing side missions or doing the main story missions you won’t be disappointed with the the variety of this game

            Rating: 10/10 since the highest it actually goes but if was up to me it would be 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10
            This game is a absolute masterpiece and I can’t recommend it enough. Thank you rockstar for this game

            So after 90 hours on this game and completing all the 6 Chapters+2 Epilogue(74 % overall) in single player mode its a *Masterpiece Beyond Comprehension*. Perhaps the greatest video game I have played. A game everyone should play. Masterful storytelling this game has one of the best stories ever made, Oscar worthy voice acting, a soundtrack you could listen to over and over, an open world that feels alive but wants you dead, characters you wish you could confide in and cuddle, graphics that have truly set the bar for open world games and an experience you will never forget like never. Once again Rockstar games manage to out do themselves. You can easily sink 100's of hours in this huge experience exploring the vast beautiful world of the west in early 1900's. There's so much to do & that's just the single player experience, when you've finished that, there's 'Red Dead Online'! A huge open world with friends and foes alike! A true gem! I truly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys real cinematic games and without hesitation, just buy it. Its worth every penny.I give this game 10/10. Go for It.

                3. The Last Of Us
            </div>
            IGN : <br />
            With The Last of Us: Remastered, PlayStation 3's best game just became PlayStation 4's, too.
            <br />
            Metro Gamecentral : <br />
            Still a stunning achievement in both storytelling and third person adventure, and although this is the definitive version the differences are still minor.
            <br />
            GamesRadar+ : <br />
            The Last of Us remains a must-play, genre-defining action survival game, and the Remastered version brings with it plentiful tweaks and additional content that make it well worth the asking price.

            It's more than a silly little block game.
            I've been playing Minecraft since July 2010, so I've seen most major updates for game. The game offers "Infinite wonders and endless possibilities" Minecraft isn't actually infinite or endless, but it might as well be due to the large amount of things you can do with the game. My favorite parts of the game are survival and hardcore singleplayer, and survival multiplayer. Minecraft may seem simple at first, but there are a lot of mechanics under the hood and there are ways to manipulate the game in unintended ways. Multiplayer is another big part of Minecraft, where I play on my private servers with friends and family. There are a lot Multiplayer servers, although most are private. My favorite is my private server and 2b2t, the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft is another experience altogether. In summary, Minecraft is a game that is definitely worth a try, and is more than a simple little block game.

            Great to pick up and put down.
            My children have started playing age 5 and I think is appropriate, although not online. I have been able to play with them, my children can all play together with the same roleplay as with physical toys and we can turn it off immediately. It is simple enough to play and go on adventures, build villages and kill monsters which is no more violent than bashing two plastic figures together. In survival mode it introduces the need to prepare, explore and gather resources (which can be time consuming to achieve). Also rearing animals for meat, eggs, wool, leather and growing crops on the correct soil and with water. There are different habitats too. You can play in peaceful mode so no hostile creatures at all. It lets them be creative and do what they want without seeking permission and still experience consequence. My only caution would be that my son has become too keen on it so we will have to have a break. Also the sounds can be spooky but they even affect me as an adult! Easy to turn the monsters off/sound off.

            Build Anything You Want in Minecraft
            Do you know what is the most popular game in the world? Is not Roblox, not Fortnite, it is Minecraft. There are almost a 500million players. Wait, you said that you are not playing Minecraft? Really? You should join this pop culture. Survival is the most popular game mode in Minecraft. It’s very exciting and dangerous, especially when you're attacked by a monster. The point is not for you to beat the boss, the most important thing about Minecraft is that you can enjoy the world. This is the best point of Minecraft, great, dangerous, mysterious, sacred, and cool buildings are all over the world. And most players will build their buildings, some are beautiful and creative, but are not that... Having no more ideas for the building is bad, but luckily, there's a shop in Minecraft, you can buy things there from other creators. some can even use commands to change the rules If you think that only I think Minecraft is fun, you're wrong. Because Minecraft is one of the most popular games in the world. You should try Minecraft, although that's not a free game. It is not only a game, it can help you with your imagination. It’s very fun. You can spend your time here every day to inspire your creativity.

                5. Uncharted: A Theft's End
            </div>
            Gustav Harborn : <br />
            I am tempted to call this a masterpiece. In my opinion this is undoubtedly the best Uncharted game in the series not just because of the superior graphics but also the story and gameplay. I may be biased because this was the first game I played in the series but I have now also completed the second and third games and while impressive for being on the PS3, they do not come close to rivaling Uncharted 4.

            With the power of the PS4, this game has larger areas. There is a lot to explore and with the stunning locations and attention to detail, this is a joy. There are notes to be found throughout the game which expand the world and present stories outside of the main story. The gameplay also benefits from the larger areas and allows for multiple paths to reach the same end goal. The areas are also more three dimensional and the grapple hook is a welcome addition.

            Most importantly I had the most fun playing this game hands down. The addition of the alert indicator on enemies and being able to mark enemies makes stealth a very viable and fun option in a lot of areas and is very satisfying to pull off. The guns feel much better in this game compared to the previous games and the controls feel very natural and easy.

            The story is both thrilling and heartfelt, the characters feel very real and everyone's motivations are clear. These are all lovable characters. The main villain isn't overly macho and "villainy" and even his motivations also provoke some sympathy. There is good female representation here as well. The dialogue throughout the game is witty and fun.

            The pacing of the game is great. A good balance between exploring, climbing and encounters with enemies. The puzzles are quite simple and straight forward but feel fun. There are some epic set pieces but that are still grounded in reality. Some sequences really makes this feel like playing a very good action/adventure film. The "supernatural" element was left out of this game, which I thought was a welcome choice. There is more focus on character development instead. The story felt more realistic but at the same time extraordinary.

            The music is great. A mixture of epic orchestral music but also some tender emotional moments as well.

            Acting, voice acting all superb and natural.

            From beginning to end this is an absolute joy to play. A truly epic adventure with a very satisfying ending. Would highly recommend this to anyone!

            Recently finished my odyssey into the exotic and exquisite world of uncharted 4. Continuing the legacy of uncharted games, uncharted 4 delivers even impressively. Though, there might not be something completely new or a league apart from the earlier Uncharted games of PS3 generation, you will however often find yourself to be amazed, astonished and dumbfounded at many junctures in gameplay. Such is the mesmerizing beauty of the world that the uncharted 4 builds  that you would just stand there savoring some of the finest green sceneries atop some grand mountain. Such is the depth of the characters of the game that you would carefully listen to their conversations and minutely watch the changes in their expression in order to understand their story better- not like an outsider but to become part of their story and evolve with them as the game progresses. Keeping in line with uncharted tradition, the action sequences are chroeographed to the utmost so as to stand on par with any high budget action movie, and the adreline push that every action-adventure gamer seeks is hightened to keep you on the edge from time to time. Though, the game is grand and magnificent as a whole, the real beauty of the game lies in  its details. The slow progression of the story, the gradual build up of the characters, minute changes in their facial expressions and the tone of the voices, as you begin to uncover their story are all part of the magic that uncharted 4 contains and uncovers. So that, after playing the game you would find yourself saying, " well, that was the time well  spent", and will have a lingering feeling of satisfaction.

            NO SPOILER REVIEW!! This is the best game ever! FACT. I have played many video games but The Uncharted 4 series tops it all. The Last of us is pretty good as well. I like how in the cinematic scenes and the scenes you play in have humorous jokes throughout the games. And not to mention, Great characters. I love how they designed Nathan and Rafe. The relationship that Nathan Drake has with people such as Sully (Victor Sullivan) And Elena (Elena Fisher) are so superb. I love the game series so much I replay it multiple times! Thanks for reading! Hope you found this helpful.
